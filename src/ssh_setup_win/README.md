# SSH Setup for Windows (future)

This folder will contain a script and instructions to collect all necessary SSH info on a Windows PC and generate a config example for the bot.

Planned:
- PowerShell script to gather:
  - Hostname, user, OpenSSH status, public key, recommended shutdown command, etc.
- Output a hosts.yml.example and SSH key if needed.

Not implemented yet â€” focus is on WoL-only mode.
